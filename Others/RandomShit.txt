Jira Ticket Title:
Review and Stabilize Flaky Integration Tests

Description:
The integration tests in our test suite have been randomly failing, which affects the stability and reliability of our CI pipeline. This task aims to identify and resolve the causes of flaky tests to improve test reliability. The review will include analyzing test failures, identifying patterns, and implementing fixes to stabilize the tests.

Scope:
Identify Flaky Tests: Review test runs to identify integration tests that fail intermittently.
Analyze Failures: Investigate logs, error messages, and run results to determine the root cause of flaky behavior.
Stabilize Tests:
Fix issues related to timeouts, resource dependencies, or race conditions.
Mock dependencies where appropriate.
Refactor test logic or introduce retries if necessary (with proper logging).
Verify Stability:
Ensure consistent test pass rates by running the tests multiple times.
Test locally and in CI/CD environments to verify stability under various conditions.
Documentation:
Document changes made and reasons behind the fixes.
Update test cases and test suite configuration if needed.
Acceptance Criteria:
Flaky tests are identified and listed.
Each flaky test has been analyzed, and the root cause of failure has been documented.
Tests have been refactored or fixed, ensuring their stability (e.g., passing consistently in 5 consecutive runs).
Test results show no intermittent failures in CI/CD for at least two full test cycles.
Relevant stakeholders are informed of the changes, and documentation has been updated.
