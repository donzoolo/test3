Step 1: Create the PowerShell Script
Open your text editor or PowerShell ISE.
Paste the following script into the editor:
powershell
Copy code
# Define paths
$templatePath = "C:\temp\temp1\template.txt"
$outputFolder = "C:\temp\temp2\"

# Read the content of the template file
$templateContent = Get-Content -Path $templatePath

# Replace %TEMP% with the current timestamp
$currentTimestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMddHHmmss"
$modifiedContent = $templateContent -replace "%TEMP%", $currentTimestamp

# Define the output file path with a unique name using the timestamp
$outputFilePath = $outputFolder + "Modified_" + $currentTimestamp + ".txt"

# Write the modified content to a new file in the output folder
$modifiedContent | Out-File -FilePath $outputFilePath

# Output the path of the created file for confirmation
Write-Output "File created at: $outputFilePath"
Save this file with a .ps1 extension, for example, ModifyAndCopyFile.ps1.
Step 2: Test the PowerShell Script
Before scheduling the script, it's a good idea to run it manually to ensure it works as expected.

Open PowerShell.
Navigate to the directory where your script is saved using the cd command.
Execute the script by typing .\ModifyAndCopyFile.ps1 and pressing Enter. Check the C:\temp\temp2\ directory to ensure the file was created correctly.
Step 3: Schedule the PowerShell Script with Task Scheduler
Open Task Scheduler: You can search for "Task Scheduler" in the Start menu and open it.
Create a New Task: In the Actions pane on the right, click "Create Task...".
General Tab: Provide a name and description for the task. Make sure "Run whether user is logged on or not" is selected and check "Run with highest privileges".
Triggers Tab: Click "New..." to create a new trigger. Set "Begin the task" to "On a schedule", and configure it to run "Daily". Then, click on "Repeat task every:" and select "1 minute" for a duration of "Indefinitely". Click "OK" when done.
Actions Tab: Click "New..." to create a new action. Set "Action" to "Start a program". In "Program/script", enter "powershell.exe". In "Add arguments (optional)", enter -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "FullPathToYourScript\ModifyAndCopyFile.ps1", replacing FullPathToYourScript with the actual path to your script. Click "OK" when done.
Conditions and Settings Tabs: Adjust these according to your preferences, although the default settings should suffice for most scenarios.
Click "OK" to save the task. You might be prompted to enter your user credentials to allow the task to run.
Your script is now scheduled to run every minute, reading the template, replacing %TEMP% with the current timestamp, and saving it in the specified directory with a unique name. Ensure that your system's power settings allow it to wake or remain awake to execute the task as scheduled.
